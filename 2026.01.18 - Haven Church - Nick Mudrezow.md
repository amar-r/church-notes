***The Body of Christ, Spiritual Gifts, and Continuing Jesus’ Ministry (1 Corinthians 12:1–31)***  

**1. The Church Is the Body of Christ — Not Ours**  
* Paul emphasizes **“body”** repeatedly to confront selfishness and individual glory.  
* The church is not “our” brand, platform, or project — it is **the Body of Christ**.  
* Jesus has:  
    * **Purchased** His church  
    * **Possesses** His people  
    * **Calls** us to live and serve **for Him**  
* Our gathering and serving is **unto Jesus**, not to please people.  

**2. Jesus Is the Head — The Body Fulfills His Will**  
* The New Testament teaches:  
    * The church is the **Body**  
    * Jesus is the **Head** (Ephesians 1:22–23)  
* The head rules; the body responds.  
* The body grows when **each part works properly** (Ephesians 4:15–16).  
* The goal: not fulfilling our will, but **fulfilling Christ’s will**.  

**3. The Church Continues Jesus’ Earthly Ministry by the Spirit**  
* The church is Jesus’ **hands, feet, and mouth** in the world today.  
* The Holy Spirit empowers believers to continue what Jesus began.  
* Jesus promised:  
    * “Whoever believes in me will do the works I do…” (John 14:12)  
    * “It is to your advantage that I go… I will send the Helper.” (John 16:7)  
* Jesus’ ministry continues globally through His Spirit-filled body:  
    * **Reconciliation** to God  
    * **Restoration** of brokenness  
    * **Healing, deliverance, provision, mercy**  
    * Caring for the least of these (feeding, visiting, serving)  

**4. The Mission Shapes the Gifts**  
* Spiritual gifts are not for building platforms, brands, or ego.  
* Everything must answer:  
    * “How does this honor Jesus?”  
    * “How does this bring people closer to God?”  
    * “How does this restore what is broken?”  
* The purpose of the Body is the **work of Jesus** — reconciliation and restoration.  

**5. A Warning: Don’t “Decapitate” the Church from the Head**  
* A common temptation: doing church by human methods while ignoring:  
    * Prayer  
    * Spirit dependence  
    * Spirit guidance  
    * Spiritual gifts  
* The goal is not efficiency or hype — it is **God’s glory** through Spirit-led ministry.  
* If the kingdom breaks in, **Jesus gets the credit**, not us.  

**6. Every Member Is Essential — Nobody Rides the Bench**  
* In the Body of Christ there is only one category: **essential personnel**.  
* “Everyone gets to play.”  
* Different roles do not mean lesser value — every part matters.  
* The body is designed for **interdependence**:  
    * No one has every gift  
    * We need each other for collective health and growth  

**7. Withdrawing Hurts the Body**  
* Separating from a local church removes something from the body:  
    * The gifts Jesus placed in you to strengthen others  
* Your active participation matters not only for your growth, but for **the church’s growth**.  
* Even what seems “small” can be indispensable (v. 22).  
* Illustration: a tiny tendon injury can disrupt the whole body.  

**8. Application Question: How Do I Discover and Grow in My Gifts?**  
* Key question:  
    * “As an essential member, how do I discover and grow the gifts Jesus has given me?”  

**9. Don’t #1 — Don’t Build Identity and Worth on Gifting**  
* Corinth’s problem: identity anchored in gifting rather than grace.  
* Two unhealthy outcomes:  
    * **Inferiority** (vv. 15–16): “Because I’m not a hand, I don’t belong.”  
    * **Superiority** (vv. 20–21): “I have no need of you.”  
* Root issue: value anchored **horizontally** (people/role), not **vertically** (Jesus).  
* Luke 10:17–20:  
    * Don’t rejoice most in power or results  
    * Rejoice that your **name is written in heaven**  

**10. Don’t #2 — Don’t Take Online Spiritual Gift Tests**  
* Spiritual gift surveys often distort the gifts and mislead more than help.  
* Better questions to ask:  
    * What burdens me? What grieves me?  
    * Who do I feel drawn to help?  
    * What energizes me and feels “easy” to do?  
    * What frustrates me when it’s missing in the church?  

**11. Don’t #3 — Don’t Use “I Don’t Have That Gift” to Disobey Jesus**  
* Lack of a gift is not an excuse to ignore clear commands:  
    * Serve  
    * Pray  
    * Love  
    * Share the gospel  
* Because the Spirit lives in believers, God can supply what’s needed in the moment.  

**12. Do #1 — Start Seeking the Lord for Gifts**  
* Scripture’s posture: not passive, but intentional.  
* “Earnestly desire the higher gifts” (1 Cor. 12:31).  
* “Pursue love, and earnestly desire spiritual gifts…” (1 Cor. 14:1).  
* Special emphasis on **prophecy**:  
    * Hearing from God for the sake of others  

**13. Do #2 — Start Serving and Let Your Gift Find You**  
* Don’t wait for “perfect clarity.”  
* Start loving, serving, and building up others.  
* As you serve, watch where God consistently empowers and bears fruit.  

**14. Do #3 — Start Stewarding What God Has Given**  
* 2 Timothy 1:6 — “Fan into flame the gift of God.”  
* Gifts are meant to be:  
    * Practiced  
    * Strengthened  
    * Developed  
    * Used for the church’s good and God’s glory  
* A strong aim for 2026:  
    * Grow in gifts through prayer, training, community, and practice  

**15. Team Mindset: Shared Suffering, Shared Joy**  
* 1 Corinthians 12:26 —  
    * If one suffers, all suffer  
    * If one is honored, all rejoice  
* Kingdom wins are shared wins — the body celebrates together.  
* Unity is part of the witness (John 17:20–23).  

**16. Closing Emphasis**  
* Pray for a church marked by:  
    * Unity  
    * Word and Spirit together  
    * Dependence on Jesus the Head  
    * Every member engaged  
* The Body exists to display Jesus and continue His mission in the world.
