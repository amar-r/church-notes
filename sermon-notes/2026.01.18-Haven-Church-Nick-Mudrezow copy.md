***The Body of Christ, Spiritual Gifts, and Continuing Jesus’ Ministry (1 Corinthians 12:1–31)***  

**1. The Church Is the Body of Christ — Not Ours**  
* Paul repeats **“body”** to confront selfishness and personal glory.  
* The church is not “the body of ___” — it is **the Body of Christ**.  
* Jesus has **purchased** His church.  
* We belong to **Jesus**, not to a pastor, leaders, or a church brand.  
* Serving, giving, and worship are done **unto Jesus**.  

**2. Jesus Is the Head — The Body Carries Out His Will**  
* The church is Christ’s body, and **Jesus is the Head** (Ephesians 1:22–23).  
* Like the brain directs the body, the Head directs the church.  
* Every member exists to fulfill the Head’s wants, wishes, and desires.  
* The body grows when each part works properly and builds up **in love** (Ephesians 4:15–16).  

**3. The Church Continues Jesus’ Ministry on Earth by the Holy Spirit**  
* Jesus reigns in heaven; His church becomes His **hands, feet, and mouth** on earth.  
* The Spirit empowers believers to continue what Jesus began.  
* Jesus promised:  
    * “Whoever believes in me will do the works that I do…” (John 14:12)  
    * “It is to your advantage that I go away… the Helper will come…” (John 16:7)  
* Sermon emphasis: the Spirit inside you is “better than Jesus beside you.”  
* Through the church today, Jesus is:  
    * Reconciling the lost back to God  
    * Cleansing condemnation and shame  
    * Bringing peace between sinners and the Father  
    * Healing and freeing the afflicted  
    * Providing for the least of these  

**4. The Mission Defines the Gifts: Reconciliation and Restoration**  
* The purpose of the body is to do the **work of Jesus**.  
* The work of Jesus is **reconciliation and restoration**.  
* Gifts must answer:  
    * How does this honor Jesus?  
    * How does this bring people closer to God?  
    * How does this bring restoration to brokenness, pain, and affliction?  
* Warning: gifts aren’t for building platforms, brands, or a church in our image.  

**5. Warning: Don’t “Decapitate” the Body from the Head**  
* Temptation: “We don’t need prayer, the Spirit, or gifts — we’ve got methods.”  
* Sermon picture: a body trying to function **without the Head**.  
* The church is called to be Spirit-led and prayer-dependent.  
* When the kingdom breaks in, **God gets the glory**.  

**6. Every Member Is Essential and Unique**  
* In the body of Christ, there are no “non-essential” members — **everyone is essential**.  
* “Everyone gets to play. Nobody rides the bench.”  
* Different roles don’t mean lesser value.  
* The design is **interdependence**:  
    * No one has every gift  
    * Jesus made it this way so we humbly need each other  

**7. Withdrawing Takes Something from the Body**  
* Withdrawing from a local church removes something from that body:  
    * the gifts Jesus placed in you to build up others  
* Your involvement matters for the **collective growth** of the church.  
* 1 Corinthians 12:22 — parts that seem weaker are **indispensable**.  
* Illustration: a tiny torn tendon affected the whole body.

## Application: Discovering and Growing in Your Gifts

**8. The Question**  
* “As an essential member, how do I discover and grow in the gifts Jesus has given me?”  

**9. Don’t #1 — Don’t Build Your Identity on Your Gifting**  
* Corinth’s issue: finding value in gifts instead of the gospel.  
* Two errors:  
    * **Inferiority** (vv. 15–16): “I’m not a hand… I don’t belong.”  
    * **Superiority** (vv. 20–21): “I have no need of you.”  
* Root cause: identity anchored in gifting, not secured in Jesus.  
* Luke 10:17–20 — don’t anchor joy in what God does through you; rejoice your **name is written in heaven**.  

**10. Don’t #2 — Don’t Take an Online Spiritual Gift Test**  
* Sermon take: gift tests distort the gifts and aren’t helpful.  
* Better questions from the sermon:  
    * What burdens me or grieves me?  
    * Who do I feel drawn to help?  
    * What excites me and makes me come alive?  
    * What feels easy and I love doing?  
    * What frustrates me when it’s missing or done poorly?  

**11. Don’t #3 — Don’t Use “I Don’t Have That Gift” to Disobey Jesus**  
* “I don’t serve because I don’t have the gift of service” was directly challenged.  
* We are all called to serve, love, pray, and obey.  
* Sermon emphasis: because the Spirit is in us, we have access to what’s needed when needs arise.  

**12. Do #1 — Start Seeking the Lord**  
* Paul’s instruction is not “cut it out” but **“pile it up”** (sermon phrasing).  
* 1 Corinthians 12:31 — “Earnestly desire the higher gifts.”  
* 1 Corinthians 14:1 — “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts…”  
* Prophecy defined in the sermon: **hearing from God for the sake of other people**.  

**13. Do #2 — Start Serving (Let Your Gifts Find You)**  
* Don’t wait for perfect clarity.  
* Start loving and serving the church and the lost, and watch how God works through you.  
* Gifts are given by God — you don’t “pick” them; you **steward** them.  

**14. Do #3 — Start Stewarding What God Has Already Given**  
* 2 Timothy 1:6 — “Fan into flame the gift of God…”  
* Stewardship means:  
    * Pray consistently for growth  
    * Get resources/teaching  
    * Learn from mature believers  
    * Practice and pursue obedience

## Team Mindset + Unity

**15. Shared Suffering, Shared Joy**  
* 1 Corinthians 12:26 — if one suffers, all suffer; if one is honored, all rejoice.  
* Kingdom wins are team wins — the body celebrates together.  

**16. Unity as Witness**  
* Jesus prayed for unity (John 17:20–23) so the world would believe and see God’s love.  

**17. Closing Emphasis**  
* Prayer for **unity** over the church.  
* A desire to honor **Word and Spirit together** — not rejecting Scripture, not rejecting gifts.  
* A church dependent on Jesus the Head, built up in love, with every member engaged.
