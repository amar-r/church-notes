***John 1:1–18 – “The Word (Logos) Made Flesh”***  
  
**1. The Eternal Word (Logos)**  
* John looks back to **Genesis 1:1** — “In the beginning…”  
* **The Word (Logos) already existed** before creation.  
* Both **Greeks** and **Jews** had existing concepts of “the Word”:  
    * **Greeks:** reason, rationality, governing principle of the universe, creative energy.  
    * **Jews:** God speaking creation into existence, God’s message through prophets, God’s Law.  
**John goes further:**  
* **The Word is a Person.**  
* **The Word entered our world.**  
* **In verse 14, John identifies the Word as Jesus.**  
    * Jesus is **eternal**, not created.  
    * Jesus is **God**.  
    * Jesus is the **Creator and Sustainer** of everything.  
  
**2. The Power of the Word**  
* John 1:3 – *“All things were made through Him.”*  
* Jesus is the **agent of creation** in Genesis 1.  
* Humans are made in **God’s image (Genesis 1:26)** — an important truth about the value and dignity of every person.  
* Everything originates from the Word:  
    * Our lives  
    * Our meaning  
    * Our purpose  
* Jesus brings **order out of chaos**, creation from nothing.  
  
**3. The Purpose of the Word**  
* John 1:4–5 — Jesus brings:  
    * **Life**  
    * **Light that shines into our darkness**  
* Jesus **entered** His creation to save it — He didn’t save from afar.  
* Illustrations used:  
    * **Christmas village ornaments** — creator vs creation and the absurdity of entering it.  
    * **Running track with his son** — we’d “zap” ourselves into moments, but we wouldn’t choose to re-live hardship.  
        * Jesus **chose** to fully live in our world with all suffering, pain, and limitations.  
  
**4. Humanity’s Darkness**  
* Darkness =  
    * Pain and suffering  
    * Ignorance  
    * Our limitations  
    * Our sin  
* Psalm 53 — *“There is none who does good… not even one.”*  
* We’re like people trapped inside a **sealed globe**, unable to escape — we need a rescuer who enters in.  
**Jesus is that Rescuer.**  
* Light stronger than darkness — darkness cannot overcome Him.  
  
**5. The Awe of the Incarnation**  
* Psalm 8 – *“What is man that You are mindful of him?”*  
    * A God so powerful caring for us **doesn’t make sense** — and that should inspire **awe, humility, and worship**.  
* God not only saves us but entrusts us with responsibility and dignity as His image-bearers.  
  
**6. Application – How to Rediscover the Wonder of the Incarnation**  
1. **Recognize you have always needed God.**  
    * Without God: darkness, wandering, exile, spiritual death.  
2. **Respond in worship and awe** because God came near.  
3. **See every person as made in God’s image.**  
    * Not just fellow believers — **everyone**.  
4. **Love as Jesus commands**:  
    * Love believers (John 13)  
    * Love the blind/unaware  
    * Love enemies  
5. **Live as Christ’s ambassadors** — hands and feet of Jesus.  
6. **Imagine a world where Christians lived this out** — and start by doing it in your small corner.  
  
**7. Closing Point**  
* **The Word is God.**  
* **Jesus is the eternal, pre-existent Creator.**  
* **He entered our darkness to bring life, light, and salvation.**  
* Our response: **awe, worship, humility, love, mission.**
